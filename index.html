          Valorant is a highly popular tactical first-person shooter (FPS) game
          developed and published by Riot Games. Released in June 2020, Valorant
          has quickly gained widespread acclaim for its engaging gameplay and
          unique blend of traditional FPS elements with character-based
          abilities. Set in a near-futuristic world, Valorant pits two teams of
          five players against each other, with one side playing as attackers
          and the other as defenders. The game revolves around the concept of
          planting and defusing a device called the Spike. The attacking team's
          objective is to plant the Spike at designated bomb sites, while the
          defending team aims to prevent the plant or defuse the Spike if it's
          planted. I have made two charts about my personal Valorant statistics.
          The Pie Chart shows the amount of matches that I have played with my
          most played agents, and the Bar Chart show the amount of kills I got
          with my most played weapons. I also show my average K/D and win
          percentage, and the source including my user where I got all of my
          information from. Lastly I also included a video about the newest
          Agent that Valorant added into the game in late October 2023.
